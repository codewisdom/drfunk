h2. Dr. Funk

This is a tool for writing and managing functional/acceptance tests. It can also be used to mark progress while manually testing an application.

A live demo is available at "http://funk.heroku.com":http://funk.heroku.com.

h2. Purpose

Working with acceptance tests can be a fairly draining process, but the value they carry is significant.

Dr. Funk eases the burden by:
* Making test steps simple to manage and edit
* Keeping organization flexible
* Leaving formatting up to the editor
* Tracking manual testing progress
